## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
    
    Chime aims to solve primarily 4 financial problems. These problems are fee transparency, accessibility, outdated technology, and financial education.
        
    * Traditional banks often carry numerous fees with them, such as maintenance fees, overdraft fees, out-of-network ATM fees, etc. This can often be hidden and unclear for customers. Chime instead opts for transparency and even elimination of some of the fees, such as no monthly fees and no minimum balance fees.
    * Chime allows those with lower incomes to cross the banking service barrier with no minimum balance fees and low fees. This is great for the younger demographic.
    * Chime approaches banking with a digital-first approach. As a financial techonology company, they aim to leverage modern technology to offer a more efficient and seamless banking experience through its mobile app.
     * Healthier financial habits are encouraged among their users. Not only does Chime and modern tools and resources, but they also emphasize financial literacy. Chime offers early direct deposit, automated savings, and alerts for low balances.

    Chime primarily targets the younger, more tech-savvy demographic who want a more convenient, low-cost, digital banking service. Their customers often include people who prefer a mobile-centric experience.

    For starters, since Chime is a FinTech company and not a traditional bank, they are cost-efficient. They save on expenses related to rent, utilities, and staffing for traditional branch locations. This allows them to allocate more resources toward innovative services and/or reduced fees for customers.
    
    Additionally, since Chime is digital-focused, they can scale rapidly without the constraints of needing physical branch locations. People in remote or underserved areas can easily access Chime with a phone and internet access.

    * In their front end, they use React, TypeScript, ES6, and React Native. React is used for web development and React Native is used for its mobile app.
    * For their back end, Chime uses Ruby, Golang, Rails, Elixir, and AWS Services. The AWS is used for cloud infrastructure, data storage, and processing. Ruby, Golang, Rails, and Elixir are popular languages and frameworks used for building high-performance backend services.
    * To visualize data, graphic.js is used for creating dynamic and visually appealing charts and visualizations. This is key for Chime's mobile-centric experience.

An investment platform would cater to users seeking diversified financial services, allowing them to invest, manage, and grow their wealth directly from the Chime app itself.

It would attract users looking for a unified platform to handle both banking and investment needs, fostering stronger customer relationships and potentially increasing the average revenue per user.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

    Technologies you would need involve trading APIs, robo-advising, and secure data analytics. Leveraging existing backend technologies like AWS infrastructure and robust security measures would be key. Integrating financial market data feeds and AI-driven algorithms will personalize each user's investment preference.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

    Trading APIs and secure data analytics ensure a reliable and secure investment experience, while AI-powered algorithms provide tailored investment suggestions based on individual goals. This aligns with Chime's user-centric approach and commitment to innovation.
